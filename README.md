# Revial

Currently, due to the age and neglect, there is a
[revival](https://github.com/mlb-/erlmud/tree/revival) branch where current
development is taking place.

# ErlMUD

ErlMUD is a MUD-like server written in erlang.

The driving idea is to write a game that can be played from multiple clients.
At the time of writing, this means a MUD-like telnet client (which will be the
initial development focus), a nethack-like webpage client (using something fun,
like websockets/socket.io(-erlang)), and a Dwarven Fortress GUI-styled
graphical client.

This project is an experiment into using Erlang/OTP and other libraries.
